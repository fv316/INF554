TODO
@Francisco: cosine similarity for tf-idf: division by vector norm

Implement these papers:
	https://github.com/williamleif/GraphSAGE
	https://github.com/tkipf/gcn
	https://github.com/vuptran/graph-representation-learning
	https://github.com/xiaohan2012/sdne-keras
Start reporting (LaTex) baseline results .i.e. results for individual features and grouped by graph/ text based
Try implementing the stellargraph python library

LATER:
Implement better corpus cleaning with stemming and lemmatization (needs to be fast)
Re-calculate text based features with cleaned text
Think about other features to extract from text (LSA after stemming)
